# SW5E-Character-Builder
This is a character builder for Star Wars 5E Character Sheets. This is my first project that I am really commiting too.
I will be building this from scratch, so a lot of things will be broken with this.

Plans:
- Create a Depot (or whatever it is called) to store all the Race, Class, Abilities, etc. for the app
- Create a fillable form that can call the information above and fill out a character sheet
- Creates a folder that stores that character information to be updated during level ups
